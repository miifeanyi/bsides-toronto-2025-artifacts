## About This Talk

This repository contains materials from my BSides Toronto 2025 presentation on AI agents in security operations. The talk explores whether AI can effectively defend against AI-powered attacks, combining research synthesis from IBM, Ponemon, and Hoxhunt studies with hands-on experimentation using open-source tools.

## Live Dashboard Demo

üîó **[View Live Dashboard](https://github.com/miifeanyi/bsides-toronto-2025-artifacts/blob/main/dashboard/index.html)**

The dashboard demonstrates:
- **Real-time threat detection** visualization with confidence scoring
- **Email analysis** with AI-powered phishing detection
- **Alert escalation queue**: AI handling 1000+ routine alerts while escalating 12 complex threats to humans
- **Implementation reality**: Shows the "AI augments, doesn't replace" philosophy in action

### Running Dashboard Locally
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/miifeanyi/bsides-toronto-2025-ai-security.git

# Navigate to dashboard directory
cd bsides-toronto-2025-ai-security/dashboard

# Option 1: Open index.html directly in your browser

# Option 2: Use Python's built-in HTTP server
python -m http.server 8000
# Then visit: http://localhost:8000
```

## Key Findings

### AI-Powered Threat Landscape
- **67%** of phishing attacks used AI in 2024 (CybelAngel)
- **55%** more effective than human-created phishing (Hoxhunt)
- **95%** cost reduction for attackers using AI tools

### AI Defense Capabilities
- **97.2%** accuracy in threat detection (Wazuh ML)
- **2-3 months** timeline to operational maturity
- **40-50%** false positives in Month 1, improving to **5-10%** by Month 3

### Implementation Reality
- AI augments human analysts, doesn't replace them
- Data quality is the primary bottleneck
- Requires ongoing tuning and feedback loops
- Best suited for high-volume, routine tasks
